# Scripts and Configs

Contains various scripts and config files that make my life less frustrating.

Since my zshrc is pretty big, it is in its own repository. It has been added as a git submodule.

## Usage

To use these scripts and configs, you just need to run ```LINKER.sh```. This script creates symbolic links to everything in their proper location (assuming the the repository is contained in ```~/Dropbox/```).

Everything would work on Mac, Linux, and hopefully any *nix / POSIX-compliant system.
